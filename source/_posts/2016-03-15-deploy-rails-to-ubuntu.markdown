when first time you access the ubuntu server by using the command:

```
ssh root@139.162.33.247
#this is mine, use you own, you can find the ip in Linode Manager -> Remote Access -> SSH Access
```

a ssh key will actomatically created in ~/.ssh/known_hosts, looks like this:

```
139.162.33.247 ssh-rsa AAA.....(bunch of alphabet).........Rn
```
